                If we had eight more weeks to work on this project, there are many things that we would like to work on. 
                There are some features that we started working on, such as input playback and procedural generation, which
                we wanted to explore furhter. Procedural generation is a great feature for a “runner” game like Gravity Guy,
                where gameplay can last indefinitely. The content generation prototype we were able to implement generates
                random levels using prefabricated level chunks, splicing them together to create unique levels. We would have
                liked to delve more into this feature, because there is a lot more that can be done there. The replay and
                playback systems could also be expanded more for some cool game ideas which we could have iterated on.
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 25px">
                The main feature that we didn’t prove in our demo game, was the ability to introduce “enemy” game objects, mainly 
                because Gravity Guy doesn’t rely on enemies to destroy or avoid. The original game is more of an obstacle course and 
                a race against time. We coded the ability to add many GameObjects, of course, but the handling of them would be in the 
                Python game logic. It just wasn’t necessary for the game we chose to demonstrate. During the first week of our extra time, 
                we could easily create another (possibly side-scroller) game to feature this ability. Spatial partitioning would be another 
                ability to quickly demonstrate in a game with many GameObjects. We would have liked to have created a game that required this.
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 25px">
                Finally, we agree as a team that the use of python tkinter for our editor was a design flaw. We made a choice to 
                start the project with tkinter because we wanted to get up and running as quickly as possible, so that we would have 
                time to begin on the actual game creation and finish all the requirements of the project. Tkinter is slow and 
                cumbersome. We could build a much better, and more professional, GUI from C++ libraries, and it would then be possible 
                to link the editor with the engine and the scripting logic to add the feature of being able to play the level as you 
                build it. If we had another eight weeks, we agree that we would start from scratch and build the editor in C++.
