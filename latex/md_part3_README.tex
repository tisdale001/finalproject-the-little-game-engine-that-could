This part is about showing off your work by building a website for your portfolio. Read the instructions below for what is needed.\hypertarget{md_part3_README_autotoc_md24}{}\doxysection{Step 0 -\/ (\+New!) Engine Architecture Diagram}\label{md_part3_README_autotoc_md24}
Your project should have an \textquotesingle{}engine architecture\textquotesingle{} diagram on your website which describes the major components of the engine. See \href{./media/C4Engine.pdf}{\texttt{ ./media/\+C4\+Engine.pdf}} as an example. Note, some IDEs can automatically generate these, though you can draw it yourself and highlight the most important components. Think of this as a high-\/level diagram you would give an engineer the first day of work so they would know the components and how they interact if they want to modify the engine.\hypertarget{md_part3_README_autotoc_md25}{}\doxysection{Step 1 -\/ Documentation}\label{md_part3_README_autotoc_md25}
Now that you are going to be maintaining the code for your company for many years, it is important to properly document your code. You will continue to use \textquotesingle{}Doxygen\textquotesingle{} \href{http://www.doxygen.nl/}{\texttt{ (Doxygen webpage)}} or \href{https://www.copperspice.com/documentation-doxypress.html}{\texttt{ Doxypress}} to document the source code and automatically generate .html pages. Your documentation should cover your classes and functions.

An example of a well documented probjects can be found here\+:

You need to have a compiled binary of your game for your operating system (Either Windows, Mac, or Linux). You can assume a target audience of either a 64-\/bit Mac, Ubuntu Linux, or a Windows 10 machine. There should additionally be instructions about how to compile your code from source. The compilation should be trivial (running {\ttfamily python build.\+py} for example, or listing a series of \textquotesingle{}apt-\/get install\textquotesingle{} in a single command or a script you have built. {\bfseries{Make it trivial}} so customers/course staff do not get frustrated \+:) ).\hypertarget{md_part3_README_autotoc_md28}{}\doxysection{Step 3 -\/ Post mortem}\label{md_part3_README_autotoc_md28}
A post mortem in games is a look back at what could be improved. Write a brief (2-\/3 paragraphs) on what could be improved if you had an additional 8 weeks to work on this project. Where would you allocate time, what tools would you build, would you use any different tools, etc.

{\itshape Edit here a draft of your post mortem here if you like--the final copy goes in your 1-\/page .html website. Think of this section as a good \textquotesingle{}reflection\textquotesingle{} for what you can improve on your next project you complete.}\hypertarget{md_part3_README_autotoc_md29}{}\doxysection{Step 4 -\/ Website}\label{md_part3_README_autotoc_md29}
I think it is incredibly important to build a portfolio of your game development works! You will be building a 1 page website(it can be all html) to market your assignment. You can re-\/use this template for your next project, and potentially other personal projects.

The following are the requirements for a 1-\/page .html page.


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Provide a 1 minute video trailer followed by at least 3 screenshots of your game (order matters, video first, then screenshots below)
\item Your documentation (i.\+e. a link to your doxygen generated files)
\item {\bfseries{An image}} of your engine architecture.
\item A link to your binary
\item A short post mortem (i.\+e. A few paragraphs describing how you would take the project further, what went well, and what you would change if given another month on the project) should be put together on a 1-\/page .html page.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

This website will be the first place I look to grab your project files and binaries.
