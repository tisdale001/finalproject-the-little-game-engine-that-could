The {\bfseries{key}} components for your project are\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item The C++ engine that does the heavy lifting and management of game objects and resources
\item A simple to use editor for building games (e.\+g. a GUI-\/based tile editor)
\item A game built in your engine (i.\+e. a class or simple game).
\end{DoxyEnumerate}\hypertarget{md_part2_README_autotoc_md17}{}\doxysection{Requirements}\label{md_part2_README_autotoc_md17}
The following are requirements of your game engine. There is significant freedom in how you achieve them, but I would like you to apply these techniques in your engine.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \mbox{[} \mbox{]} Implement a resource manager
\item \mbox{[} \mbox{]} Implement a GUI-\/based editor/environment for building your game (i.\+e. An extension of the tilemap editor)
\item \mbox{[} \mbox{]} Your engine must be data-\/driven
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \mbox{[} \mbox{]} Scripts should be loaded for the gameplay logic
\item \mbox{[} \mbox{]} Other configuration files (e.\+g. levels) should be loaded at run-\/time.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item \mbox{[} \mbox{]} Your engine should be component-\/based {\bfseries{or}} use some other logical pattern for organizing game objects (At a minimum you should have a gameobject class).
\item \mbox{[} \mbox{]} Something {\bfseries{extra}} that gives your engine a \textquotesingle{}wow\textquotesingle{} factor to show off to the TA\textquotesingle{}s and instructors. Highlight this in your video (could be engineering, could be a gameplay mechanic that you designed your engine around, the goal is that it is something non-\/trivial)
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md_part2_README_autotoc_md18}{}\doxysection{Gameplan}\label{md_part2_README_autotoc_md18}
Given the above requirements, you may use this space to write some notes in. I suggest coming up with a timeline with your team members.

For example\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Week 1 -\/ Form groups and agree on project, start dividing some responsibilities
\item Week 2 -\/ Gather resources, from previous assignments and start planning
\item Week 3 -\/ 5 Implementation of Editor and main components of engine
\item Week 6 -\/ Continue iterating on engine, and build prototype of game.
\item Week 7 -\/ Put together website and polish off bugs
