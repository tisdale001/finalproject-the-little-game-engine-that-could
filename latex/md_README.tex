For this assignment you are going to be building a \textquotesingle{}Game Maker\textquotesingle{} as your final project!

You will have some flexibility and creativity in how the overall game making engine is built and what types of game(s) your engine can make.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md31}{}\doxysubsection{Logistics}\label{md_README_autotoc_md31}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item You will be working on this assignment as a team on your choice (or a combination) of the Mac, Linux, or Windows Operating Sytstem.
\item You will put all of your code and deliverables in the \href{./Engine}{\texttt{ Engine}} directory.
\item Make sure everyone has a way to work on this codebase, with a common set of tools.
\item Everyone should make code contributions to the repository (i.\+e. everyone should have some commits in the project log)

Description  ~\newline
 

25\% (Engineering/\+Design Patterns) 

On the polish of your final project (did it work as intended, were there bugs, did I have to struggle to get your tool running, was your solution well engineered, were there patterns used, etc.)  

40\% (Requirements) 

Did you complete all of the requirements from part 2?  

10\%\% (Wow Factor) 

On the creativity and overall \textquotesingle{}wow\textquotesingle{} factor of your project. Was there a cool feature or surprise that got me excited about the project? Does this project have potential to be extended in the future? Were there creative additional tools that supported your work. Was there something not covered in class that you were excited about, learned, and implemented anyway? (Document this to bring to my attention if so!)  $<$/tbody$>$ \hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md36}{}\doxysection{Part 3 -\/ Rubric (20\%)}\label{md_README_autotoc_md36}

4\% (Engine Architecture diagram) 

Did you add the engine architecture diagram to your website \char`\"{}./media/\+C4\+Engine.\+pdf\char`\"{}?  ~\newline
 

4\% (Documentation) 

Did you generate something like \char`\"{}http\+://www.\+horde3d.\+org/docs/html/\+\_\+api.\+html\char`\"{}?  ~\newline
 

4\% (Build) 

Does the build work when I download your repo and run the game?  

4\% (Post mortem) 

Did you learn anything and provide a brief and well-\/thought out reflection of these learnings?  

4\% (Website) 

Do you have a webpage that presents your project in a positive way with the above materials.  $<$/tbody$>$ \hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md37}{}\doxysection{Teammate Evaluation -\/ Rubric (5\%)}\label{md_README_autotoc_md37}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Pragmatically
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item It is useful to work in separate branches in git, and then merge your code to master, and then resolve the merge conflicts (ideally with the person you are working with).
\item If you are uncomfortable with this in github, then pair programming may be a viable option (I do however want to see commits from everyone).
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item On working with others
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Be responsive
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Check your email, respond to your teammates within 24-\/48 hours on the preferred communication platform
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Be proactive
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Alert the course staff if there are issues sooner rather than later--we cannot do anything the last day before the project is due.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Contribute
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The course staff looks at the commit logs to make sure everyone participated (No free rides--earn your grade!)
\item Note\+: One team member doing all the work is not heroic either
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Balance the work load--no one should complete more than 50\% of the project on a 4 person team for example.
